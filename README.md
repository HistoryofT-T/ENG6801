## ENG 6801 version control project
This is a collaborative project for practicing version control for the Spring 2020 UCF ENG 6801 course. 
You will be creating a collaborative syllabus for ENG 6800: Introduction to Texts and Technology.
Instructions for the assignment can be found on our Webcourses site.

The IntroToT&TSyllabus.md file is the syllabus skeleton that you will be editing.
**Course Policies**

**Attendance**
The expectation is for students to be in every class, on time. Classes are absolutely essential to success in the course. If you cannot be at a class, let me know before-hand. The following types of absences are allowed upon previous notification: 
 
- Religious holidays.
- Authorized UCF or academic events.
- Legal obligations.
 
**Classroom Behavior, Violence and Harassment**
Respect between everyone in class is expected. It’s assumed that everyone in class has academic freedom, which means that ideas and positions, even unpopular ones, can be expressed. What comes with that, though, is a need for both respect and empathy for others, as well as an openness to ideas that may not directly align with your own. 
 

**Late Papers**
On late papers in general: The due dates are firm. There will be penalties for late papers. If there is a legitimate reason for a paper being late, I am willing to consider it and waive the late penalty. Unacceptable reasons include:
·"I had too much work" (you could have started earlier) 
·"My computer deleted my file" (make back-ups) 
·"I'm on a team and we were away" (work that out with your coach, not me) 
·"I couldn't think of a topic" (come & see me early) 
·"I just procrastinated - it's a problem for me" (if you know this is a problem, plan ahead to deal with it) 
 
**Communication of Grade**
Grade reporting to students will happen through Webcourses, in all course modalities. The university follows the national FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) code, which does not allow the communication of grades to a student by email (including embedding them in documents, which means they cannot be placed on a paper emailed to me), or by posting them outside a professor's door. This is a confidentiality issue.
 
**General Communication with Students**
Contact will be through Webcourses or through email. All communication between student and instructor and between student and student should be respectful and professional. Knightsmail is the only official student email at UCF. Class rosters list Knightsmail addresses rather than external email addresses, and all official class communications will be sent only to the Knightsmail addresses. Students are responsible for checking their Knightsmail accounts regularly. See the [FAQ](https://knightsemail.ucf.edu/FAQ/) for further information. Generally, you can expect a response for emails within two school days.
 
**Academic Honesty** 
As with all matters of student conduct, academic honesty is governed by the "Golden Rule". We will discuss the nature of academic honesty in class, but a note here is warranted. Basically, your work should be your own and original to this class, and when you are drawing on the words, images, or ideas of others, this should be properly noted.

**Disability Access** 
The University of Central Florida is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course must contact the professor at the beginning of the semester to discuss needed accommodations. No accommodations will be provided until the student has met with the professor to request accommodations. Students who need accommodations must be registered with Student Disability Services, Student Resource Center Room 132, phone (407) 823-2371, TTY/TDD only phone (407) 823-2116, or [via this URL](https://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/), before requesting accommodations from the professor.
 
**Financial Aid Reporting** 
All faculty are required to document students’ academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the following academic activity by the end of the first week of classes or as soon as possible after adding the course: MODULE 1 QUIZ. Failure to do so may result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.
 
**Controversial Content** 
Many of my courses deal with issues in contemporary culture. Occasionally, there may be controversial content - concepts, images, opinions - that we will consider. If you feel uncomfortable with this, please let me know and we can try to make accommodations, but everyone should be aware that the nature of the humanities studies is to consider a wide range of ideas and images, some of which will be offensive to some people. The goal is not to endorse these ideas, but to understand and analyze them. Academic freedom extends to everyone in the class, but so does academic responsibility and compassion. 
 
**Drop/Swap, Withdrawal, Academic Calendar** 
It is the student's responsibility to drop or withdraw from the course if there is an unavoidable conflict or if the need should arise for another reason. Students who fail to drop before the deadline established in the curriculum catalogue will receive an F for the course. All dates relevant to this term are available in the academic calendar, [located here.](https://calendar.ucf.edu/)
 
**Copyright**
The course may contain copyrighted materials. These materials are made available to students through the Fair Use doctrine to enhance the learning environment. Please do not copy, duplicate, download, or distribute these materials.
 
**Mandatory Reporting and UCF Care**
Professors have the responsibility to report any information regarding sexual misconduct or crimes happening on campus by contacting UCF student support agency. For more information, visit UCFCares.com, email at ucfcares@ucf.edu, or call (407) 823-5607. Counseling available 24/7 at (407) 823-2811 (then press #5).
 
**Campuis Saftey**
